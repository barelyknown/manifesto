The trip to my parents' house for Thanksgiving usually takes about two hours. Today there was a snowstorm and it took four.

Our oldest is home from college for a few days. It's her freshman year. We keep in touch daily by txt message. It just isn't the same.

But we had four hours, three kids, two parents, one dog, and nothing else to do. Thanksgiving.
