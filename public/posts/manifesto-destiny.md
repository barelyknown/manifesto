I'm 40 years old; exactly two weeks from 41.

A blog feels, how do you say, _unbecoming_.

**...but a manifesto!**

The former is the want of my late 20s, _whereas_ the latter embraces mortality in the way that middle age should.

This is a public declaration, née plea, _wherein_ I state my opinions for the record.

_Wherefore‽_
