# the barelyknown manifesto

[www.barelyknown.com](https://www.barelyknown.com)

> I'm 40 years old; exactly two weeks from 41.
>
> A blog feels, how do you say, _unbecoming_.
>
> **...but a manifesto!**
>
> The former is the want of my late 20s, _whereas_ the latter embraces mortality in the way that middle age should.
>
> This is a public declaration, née plea, _wherein_ I state my opinions for the record.
>
> _Wherefore‽_
